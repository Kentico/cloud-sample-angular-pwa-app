Travel application featuring various points of interests around you written in [Angular](https://angular.io/) and using [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com) as a data source.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project is using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5. To be able to run ng command, it is required to install it by ```npm i -g @angular/cli```.

### Application setup

1. Install the latest version of NodeJS and npm. You can download both at <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.
2. Clone the sample application repository.
3. Navigate to the root folder of the application in the command line.
4. Type `npm install` to install required npm packages.
5. Type `npm start` to start a development server.
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
